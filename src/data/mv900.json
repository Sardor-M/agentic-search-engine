  "tagline": "A New Era in Smart Process Monitoring",
  "description": "The MV900 is a process monitoring system that analyzes sensor signals in real time on metal forming sites to monitor product and equipment conditions. During forming, equipment pressure is monitored to stop machines instantly when defects occur, preventing continuous errors. Combined with sensors and AI, it tracks 4M, power, and equipment changes for real-time production management.",
